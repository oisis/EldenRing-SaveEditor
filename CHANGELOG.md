## [Unreleased]

### Branch: fix/dlc-map-reveal-v2 — DLC black tile removal (SOLVED)

**Problem:** DLC "Shadow of the Erdtree" map had persistent black tiles that could not be removed via event flags, FoW bitfield, map items, or any known mechanism.

**Root cause:** The DLC map cover layer is controlled by two position records in the BloodStain section (afterRegs+0x0088..0x0110). These records contain DLC-area coordinates that tell the game the player has physically explored the DLC map. Without them, the game renders black tiles over the DLC map regardless of all other flags.

**Solution:** Write synthetic DLC coordinates into the BloodStain section:
- Record 1 (afterRegs+0x008D): X=9648.0, Y=9124.0, flag=0x01
- Record 2 (afterRegs+0x00C5): X=3037.0, Y=1869.0, Z=7880.0, W=7803.0, flag=0x01

**Changes:**
- `app.go`: `revealDLCMap()` — added Phase 3 (DLC black tile removal via synthetic coordinates)
- `backend/core/offset_defs.go`: Added `DLCTile*` constants for BloodStain position offsets
- `backend/db/data/maps.go`: Added 237 dungeon map flags (62100-62999) to `MapVisible`, updated `IsDLCMapFlag()` range
- `spec/29-dlc-black-tiles.md`: Full research documentation with binary search results

**Testing:** 20 iterative tests on Steam Deck, confirmed working with base game + DLC map fully revealed.

### Branch: fix/dlc-map-reveal (experimental, not merged)

Deep research into DLC (Shadow of the Erdtree) map black tiles removal.

**Research findings (2025-04-25):**
- DLC ownership confirmed — not a runtime entitlement check
- Game resets ALL map event flags on load, then rebuilds from ground truth
- DLC map fragment items survive game reset (persist in inventory)
- FoW bitfield is shared between base game and DLC (same 2099-byte range)
- CsDlc bytes[3-49] are NOT always zero (contradicts earlier spec)
- Event flags 62080-62084 survive game load when set alongside grace flags
- **Black tiles persist despite correct flags, items, regions, and graces**

**Approaches tested (all failed to remove black tiles):**
1. Event flags 62080-62084 + 82002 only
2. Above + DLC map fragment items
3. Above + CsDlc byte[1]=1 (DLC entry flag)
4. Above + story progression flags
5. FoW bitfield extension beyond 0x10B0
6. er-save-manager flag toggle (same flags, no items/FoW)
7. Above + 105 DLC grace flags (72xxx, 74xxx, 76xxx) + acquisition flags 63080-63084
8. Above + 10 DLC region IDs (6800000-6941000) via byte insertion

**Code changes (on branch, not merged):**
- `backend/db/data/maps.go`: Added `DLCGraces` (105 DLC grace flags), `DLCRegions` (10 DLC overworld region IDs), fixed `IsDLCMapFlag()` range (removed incorrect 62800-62999)
- `backend/core/writer.go`: Added `AddRegionsToSlot()` — bulk region ID insertion with byte shifting and offset update
- `app.go`: Rewrote `revealDLCMap()` — now sets regions, graces, visibility flags, system flags, and items
- `spec/28-dlc-map-reveal.md`: Full research documentation

**Key remaining hypothesis:**
- CsDlc byte[1] (SotE entry flag) = 48 in reference save, 0 in ours. Game only sets it via proper DLC entry (Miquella's hand), not via teleport. This may be the master switch for DLC map rendering. Untested with current region/grace setup.

**Diagnostic tools created (tmp/, not committed):**
- `tmp/diag-dlc/main.go` — applies revealDLCMap to a save copy, compares with clean and reference slot
- Multiple Python analysis scripts used in-session for binary diff, flag scanning, region analysis
